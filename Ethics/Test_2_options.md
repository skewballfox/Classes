note: I need 2 papers by friday, 2-4 pages a piece. 

1. Kant argued that we should not treat people as a means only. What does he mean by this? 

from wikipedia:

"Kant's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative is to treat humanity as an end in itself:

    Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means.
    — Immanuel Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785)[24]

Kant argued that rational beings can never be treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to be used merely as a means to an end, so they must always be treated as an end.[25] Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such.[26][27][28] This does not mean that we can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.[25] "

'He used me !', I might say angrily when someone deceives me through feigned friendship to disclose information or to 'borrow' money he had no intention of returning. 'Sure he suckered up to her. He just used her to get promotion'. 'He spiked the guy's drink just to use him sexually'. What pulls these examples together as cases of using people simply as means ?

    We use their humanity simply as a means, on the other hand, if we get them to adopt plans they would not otherwise have adopted by trickery, deception, or illegitimate threats.

    The underlying idea here, I suggest, is that treating persons as ends is a matter of treating the choices and plans they adopt free from these kinds of manipulation - their values, if you will - as at least ceteris paribus worthy of pursuit, the ends they set as worth attaining. What it forbids, at least in reasonably propitious circumstances, is manipulation by deceit and illegitimate coercion. And so, in our dealings with others, we are to seek, so far as possible, voluntary accommodation in which we can both achieve what we, in the end, choose. When we treat others simply as means, we achieve our own ends by treating theirs with indifference or worse.

2. Care ethics focuses on relationships. What is meant by care ethics?  What does it mean when it is refernced as honoring feelings? 

holds that moral action centers on interpersonal relationships and care or benevolence as a virtue
    Attentiveness
    Attentiveness is crucial to the ethics of care because care requires a recognition of others' needs in order to respond to them.[17] The question which arises is the distinction between ignorance and inattentiveness.[17] Tronto poses this question as such, "But when is ignorance simply ignorance, and when is it inattentiveness"?[17]
    Responsibility
    In order to care, we must take it upon ourselves, thus responsibility. The problem associated with this second ethical element of responsibility is the question of obligation. Obligation is often, if not already, tied to pre-established societal and cultural norms and roles. Tronto makes the effort to differentiate the terms "responsibility" and "obligation" with regards to the ethic of care. Responsibility is ambiguous, whereas obligation refers to situations where action or reaction is due, such as the case of a legal contract.[17] This ambiguity allows for ebb and flow in and between class structures and gender roles, and to other socially constructed roles that would bind responsibility to those only befitting of those roles.
    Competence
    To provide care also means competency. One cannot simply acknowledge the need to care, accept the responsibility, but not follow through with enough adequacy - as such action would result in the need of care not being met.[17]
    Responsiveness
    This refers to the "responsiveness of the care receiver to the care".[17] Tronto states, "Responsiveness signals an important moral problem within care: by its nature, care is concerned with conditions of vulnerability and inequality".[17] She further argues responsiveness does not equal reciprocity.[17] Rather, it is another method to understand vulnerability and inequality by understanding what has been expressed by those in the vulnerable position, as opposed to re-imagining oneself in a similar situation.[17]
maybe:

3. We discussed the ethics of the person, including the concepts of respect and autonomy. Fully explain both of these concepts.

4. Give an explanation of the four families of moral values.
