# Class Notes

## Generalized Proof example
prove that the square root of 2 is irrational

proof by contradiction
suppose $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, then by the definition of a rational number there exist two numbers $p$ and $q$ that are relatively prime.

$\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}$

$(\sqrt{2})^2=(\frac{p}{q})^2$

$2=(\frac{p^2}{q^2})$

$p^2=2q^2$

since $p^2$ is 2 * a number, p is even

by definition of an even number it could be expressed as $2m$

so $p^2=4m^2=2q^2$

this would mean that $q$ is an even number

since both p and q are even, this would mean that they are not irriducible, because 2 would be a common factor. therefore, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational

## Notations

$Big(\Omicron)$ notation is the upperbound of the performance

$Big(\Theta)$ is more the generalized performance measure

$Big(\Omega)$ is the lowerbound of the performance measure

## Algorithm Complexity

Given an algorithm, how efficient is this algorithm for solving a problem given input of a particular size?

time complexity -- how long it takes

and space complexity -- how much space it requires
