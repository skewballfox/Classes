# Loop invariant

## use
can be used in proofs for proving the correctness of iterative algorithms

## Basic definition
An assertion (property) among the program variables which $P(x_1,...,x_k)$ is always true when control reaches that point

## Correctness

### Patial Correctness:
If the program terminates then it produces the correct answers

### Total correctness:
partial correctness + termination
